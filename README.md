![Screenshot of the project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WiGeeky/WiGeeky.github.io/master/screenshot.png)

This is the code for the landing page of my website ([accessible at mikey.ir](https://mikey.ir)), as of October 2020, this code is still in use.

I have made this open-source for the sake of simplicity and to give people ideas, it's not currently complicated by any means but if you like it, feel free to fork it and make it your own. Cheers!
